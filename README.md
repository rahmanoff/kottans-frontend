## Linux CLI, and HTTP

- [x] Done! :tada:

I had some knowledge about shell, terminal, bash and commands before. It was a good oportunity to repeat.
Knowing of such commands give you more control of your machine and helps do cli tasks quicker.

Did some Git Collaboration before, but it was all around 'git init', 'git clone', 'git pull' and 'git push'. Now I feel more comfortable with branches and commits "adventures".
